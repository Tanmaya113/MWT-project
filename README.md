# 🛍️ MUJ DigiHAAT

**MUJ DigiHAAT** is a student-to-student digital marketplace designed specifically for the Manipal University Jaipur (MUJ) community. It allows students to buy, sell, and exchange items like books, gadgets, hostel essentials, and even offer or request services — all within a structured, trustworthy, and campus-centric platform.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In most universities, peer-to-peer transactions happen informally through WhatsApp groups or word-of-mouth. These solutions are cluttered, inefficient, and difficult to manage. Posts get lost, there's no organization or searchability, and trust between buyers and sellers can be uncertain.

**MUJ DigiHAAT** solves this by creating a clean, dedicated platform where students can:
- 🛒 Buy & sell academic materials and daily essentials
- 🔁 Exchange goods and services easily
- 👨‍🎓 Connect only with MUJ peers in a secure space
- 📱 Enjoy a smooth, responsive user experience
